Hello, everyone!                                                           0.2.8

This is uwm, the ultimate window manager, which will be one day part of ude,
the unix desktop environment.

The first thing you might wonder about is where the BETA in the version number
has gone, and yes, you're right: this is no longer a beta release. Although
uwm has by far not yet all the features i'ld like it to have i decided that
the time has come now to face it: uwm's reached a state of very high stability
and reliability. Nothing to worry about, just a natural step ;) The fact that
there's still a whole bunch of features missing is indicated by the major
versoin number 0.

As always, for info on how to compile uwm, please check out the INSTALL and
INSTALL.UDE files.
For questions on how to use and configure uwm, please check out the file
manual.dvi in the docs directory.

Please also note that our url at ude.org is no longer available, the project
has migrated to sourceforge and can be reached at

                       http://udeproject.sourceforge.net.

Mirror pages also might be down or outaged due to some problems with the
migration.

For bug reports, suggestions etc. please contact Christian Ruppert <arc@gmx.li>

Have fun with this first officially stable release.

oh, and don't forget: we're still looking for developers, designers etc. The
more people work on this project the higher the chances are that one day we'll
reach a major version number of 1.
contact us if you're interested.

ude - get used to it.
