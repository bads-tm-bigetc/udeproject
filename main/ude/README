Hello, everyone!                                            SNAPSHOT JUN 26 2000

This is uwm, the ultimate window manager, which will be one day part of ude, the
unix desktop environment.

********************************************************************************
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is just a development snapshot. it should *theoretically* be running stable
but it's not completely tested.

This snapshot was released since a major bug was discovered (nothing to worry
about yet if you don't change workspaces really fast (about 10 times a second
on a modern machine with several apps running)) but it could become a problem
in future versions and it needs to be fixed. Unluckily fixing the bug
requires rewriting parts of the main wm and handler functions. I'll use this
opportunity to also finish icccm2.0 compliance and clean up the code a little
bit. So the next version will probably be 0.3.0, release date unknown (don't
expext it too soon, i'll probably release some more snapshots as soon as the
wm-functions work again so that the new routines can be tested).

thanx to shawn for reporting the bug.
