TODO-list for the ude desktop-library:

ude-button.c:
  * add support for radio lists (UDEButtonRadio flag)
  * add support for deactivated buttons (UDEButtonSelectable flag)
  * add a destructor and a modifier function.
  * save wether the hex shape was created by the constructor to free it in the
    destructor

ude-box.c:
  * add and support a children's list for each box. we can use the uwm
    nodes-module for that.
  * do refreshs in case of a workspace switch
  * set a box's background color automatically to the selected background color
    if not overriden.
  * add a ude default handler 'refresh' which will (re-) draw the box.

very incomplete yet... however this should be the most urgent things.
