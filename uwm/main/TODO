=== TODO ===

high priority:
--------------
- use ultimatelist for gradientplace instead of x-server query

- fix menu flickering problem (hex and normal menus) once and for all

- dynamic workspace system ("infinite" workspaces)
     - paste name of workspace in menu.

- fix window state machine:
     - transform all data structures to lazy (i.e. update only on reception
       of Notify-Events)
  WAS: mplayer -fs problem. SEE handwritten notes on state machine or
       contact christian <arc@users.sf.net> for details.

normal priority:
----------------
- truncate window titles in menus and title bars - should be easy to do

- menu color inversion for better visibility

- (basic) freedesktop.org support:
     - xinerama
     - desktop resizing
     - workspace management freedesktop conformant?

- borderless maximize windows (one pixel border on bootom is left to hex menu,
  workspace menus in bottom corners)

low priority:
-------------
- stay on top/bottom windows

- send events so that xt-applications will recognize changed colors when a
  workspace has changed (might be complex to do... needs to be examined if
  it's worth the trouble)

- font antialiasing using Xft or XRender (XRender also for
  animated/transparent cursors?)

- manage Cut-buffer - might also be left to xcliboard etc, very low priority


=== done? ===
- bugfix window border drawing (focus/no focus problems) - seems to be ok.
