P: There is a problem when the middle-button is pressed and the mouse is moved
   at the same time (e.g. with standard window-moveing: The pointer doesn't grab
   the window's border properly and 'slips' so that it can even leave the border
   and no proper window moving is possible.)
S: You should check your X-server to be configured correctly: ChordMiddle
   usually must not be enabled to make the X-server send mouse-buttons-events
   properly. The Buttons-option must be set to the correct number of buttons
   your mouse provides. Furthermore Emulate3Buttons should not be enabled if
   you do not have a 2-button-mouse.
   See Man-page for XF86Config for closer information on how to configure your
   X-server correctly.
